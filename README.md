# My Portfolio Website

I have created a portfloio to showcase my skills and projects. To achive this, I implemented the following:

## BEM methodology

Structured code that's easy to understand and easily scalable.

## Sass

Enabled me to break different components down into separate Sass files, with the potential to re-use elements in future projects.

## Flexbox

I created layouts throughout the page with a Flexbox. The website is responsive on multiple screen widths.

## Bootstrap

I used Bootstrap framework to create really nice looking components like navigation, project cards, form and buttons.
